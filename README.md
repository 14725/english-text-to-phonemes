# English text to phonemes

A quick and easy algorithm to convert English text to speech representation in the form of [IPA symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet). This is **not** a state of the art algorithm for speech synthesis. It is rather a quick and easy way to get a auditive profile of an English text. It is useful, for example, if you are automatically analyzing the vocal properties of English poems.

Rules are derived from Elovitz, Honey S., et al. [*Automatic translation of English text to phonetics by means of letter-to-sound rules*](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a021929.pdf). No. NRL-7948. NAVAL RESEARCH LAB WASHINGTON DC, 1976.
