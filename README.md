# English text to phonemes

A quick and easy algorithm to convert English text to speech representation in the form [IPA symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet). This is **not** a state of the art algorithm for speech synthesis. It is rather a quick and easy way to get a auditive profile on an English text. It is useful, for example, if you are automatically analyzing the vocal properties of English poems.
